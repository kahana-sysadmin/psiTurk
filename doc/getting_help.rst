Getting help
============

There are a number of ways to get help with psiTurk.

1. The `https://psiturk.org <https://psiturk.org>`__ has meta-information about
    the system.

2. Usage questions should go to the psiTurk Google Group `here <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psiturk>`__.
    Search for answers to common questions or post your own. Chances are if you
    run into a problem someone else will as well.

3. Potential bugs in the code, or feature requests, should be posted as a
    `github issue <https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/issues>`__
    This is an open discussion of possible issues, bugs, feature requests, etc.
    Browse the open and closed issues first before posting.
    See the :ref:`guide for contributors <contributing-to-psiTurk>`
    for more information about using the issues tracker.

4. `Todd Gureckis <http://gureckislab.org/~gureckis>`__  taught a class covering
    online data collection and psiTurk at NYU Spring 2014. All lectures were
    videotaped and are available `here <http://gureckislab.org/courses/spring14/online_data_collection/>`__.

5. Follow `@psiturk <https://twitter.com/psiturk>`__ on Twitter for helpful
    tips and breaking news.

6. If all else fails and you feel you simply cannot get help, you can consider
    emailing `authors@psiturk.org <mailto:authors@psiturk.org>`__, the benevolent
    dictators of the project and system architects. However, if you haven't
    first pursed the above options, you may not get a quick response.
